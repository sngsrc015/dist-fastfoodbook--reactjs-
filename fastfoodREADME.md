# dist-fastfoodbook--reactjs-
It was quite difficult challange for me ,but still I manage the whold design by myself and specially i did hardwork in backend which is quite logical and time consuming . This is project actually about a fast food booking where i use many dependencies and specially redux toolkit which is big help for me. for authorization i used protect routers , For front end design i use mui style-component initially it is not responsive but i still working on tailwind css and bootstrap. so it will not be hard for me.
